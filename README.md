# AquaBrain
Aquarium Control
This code is to be used with a Particle Core (Previously known as Spark Core).

We will be monitoring temperatures and water flow in two places:
  #1 Water flow from the aquarium into the sump.
  #2 Water flow from the sump pump back into the aquarium.
  
The reason why we are checking flow levels in these two places is to make sure that neither the aquarium, nor the sump are flooding.
